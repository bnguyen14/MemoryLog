# MemoryLog
A basic leitner-style spaced repitition studying program. Written for the command line, this program allows a user to have reminders for when they need to review something on a day-to-day basis so that they can maximize the use of their studying time. Items can have an associated quiz that the user can take when that item appears in the list. The quizzes simulate a random flash-card deck that accepts text answers only.

Classes TestManager.java, Quiz.java, Question.java, and TestManagerLauncher.java belong to the quizletcopy package.

Classes MemoryLog.java, DateComparator.java, Item.java and OurDate.java belong to the memorylog package.
